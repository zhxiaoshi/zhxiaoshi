<p>“<strong>In particular</strong>“ is an idiomatic expression that means “in distinction from others” or “specifically”. This expression usually refers to nouns and is set apart by a comma when it occurs at the beginning of a sentence or a phrase.<br>“<strong>Particularly</strong>“ means “in detail” or “to an unusual degree”. It is an adverb, and as such it can be used to modify a verb, an adjective, or another adverb but not nouns. It is not set off by a comma from the rest of the sentence.</p>

<p>—<br><strong>contest</strong> is more casual than <strong>competition</strong>. a competition relies more on intelligence while a contest is associated to brute strength (well, I have my doubts about this one) a contest always involves a prize while competition usually doesn’t. a contest refers to a single event while a competition can last a whole season.<br>—<br><strong>Awards</strong> vs. <strong>Rewards</strong>. An <strong>award</strong> is a special prize such as the Oscar. It is usually connected to a contest or social event. A **reward **can be anything you get for making an effort, or as an incentive, say like cash back in credit cards, or miles, even a small cookie for “being good.”<br>—<br><strong>Among</strong> is the earlier word of this pair: according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it first appeared in Old English. The variant form, <strong>amongst</strong>, is a later development, coming along in the Middle English period. With regard to their meanings, there’s no difference between among and amongst.<br>—<br>**Retain **is a transitive verb meaning ‘to keep’ something. <strong>Remain</strong> is an intransitive verb meaning to stay in the same place, or to continue to exist.<br>—<br>As nouns the difference between <strong>origin</strong> and <strong>genesis</strong> is that <strong>origin</strong> is the beginning of something while <strong>genesis</strong> is the origin, start, or point at which something comes into being.<br>—<br><strong>Perhaps/Maybe</strong> – is used when something or someone is uncertain or not sure (40% - 60% chance). There is really no different between perhaps &amp; maybe, both words can be used interchangeably.<br><strong>Probably <strong>– means that there is a good chance of something happening (70% – 95% chance)<br>—<br>As nouns the difference between</strong> impact</strong> and <strong>implication</strong> is that impact is the striking of one body against another; collision while implication is (uncountable) the act of implicating. </p>
<p>As a verb <strong>impact</strong> is to compress; to compact; to press or pack together. </p>
<p>—<br><strong>Lawyer</strong> is a general term for a person who gives legal device and aid and who conducts suits in court. An <strong>attorney</strong> or, more correctly, an attorney-at-law, is a member of the legal profession who represents a client in court when pleading or defending a case. In the US, attorney applies to any lawyer.</p>

<p><em><strong>Collaboration</strong></em> is working together to create something new in support of a shared vision. The key points are that it is not through individual effort, something new is created, and that the glue is the shared vision.</p>
<p><em><strong>Coordination</strong></em> is sharing information and resources so that each party can accomplish their part in support of a mutual objective. It is about teamwork in implementation. Not creating something new.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cooperation</strong></em> is important in networks where individuals exchange relevant information and resources in support of each other’s goals, rather than a shared goal. Something new may be achieved as a result, but it arises from the individual, not from a collective team effort.</p>

<p><strong>Modest</strong> describes the personality trait or behaviour of not flaunting oneself, talking oneself up or putting oneself on display. Modest behaviour can be a response to compliments, praise or follow an achievement. Modesty can also manifested physically (for example, “dressing modestly”, “modest accessories”, “modest smile”).</p>
<p>In contrast, “<strong>humble</strong>“ refers specifically to a person’s inner state and feelings. A humble person is willing to accept or respect another’s authority, intellect and wisdom, or superiority without trying to challenge it or trying to assert oneself.</p>
<p>In summary, being modest refers to your behaviour, being humble refers to your ego. </p>

<p><em><strong>Cooperating</strong></em> means working with someone in the sense of enabling: making them more able to do something (typically by providing information or resources they wouldn’t otherwise have).</p>
<p><em><strong>Collaborating</strong></em> means actually working alongside someone (from Latin laborare: to work) to achieve something.</p>
